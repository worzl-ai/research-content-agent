# Tools and Integrations for Research & Content Agent

This document outlines the key tools and integrations required for the Research & Content Agent, designed to operate within the Google Cloud/Vertex AI stack.

## Core Intelligence

1.  **Vertex AI (Gemini Models):**
    *   **Purpose:** Core engine for natural language understanding and generation.
    *   **Usage:**
        *   Understanding user prompts and research requests.
        *   Performing web searches via integrated search tools or APIs.
        *   Analyzing search results and source materials.
        *   Generating content drafts (blog posts, articles, summaries).
        *   Keyword research and analysis (identifying relevant terms, search volume, difficulty - potentially via integrated tools/APIs).
        *   Suggesting relevant categories, tags, and internal links.
        *   Generating Schema.org JSON-LD snippets for content.
        *   Adhering to writing best practices (`38_writing_best_practices.md`).
    *   **Integration:** Via Vertex AI SDK/API calls within the agent's Python code (`02_agent_research_content_structure.py`).

## Data Sources & Input

1.  **Google Search (or equivalent Search API):**
    *   **Purpose:** Gathering information from the web for research, topic ideation, and competitor analysis.
    *   **Usage:** Executing search queries based on user requests or identified topics.
    *   **Integration:** Either through direct API calls (e.g., Google Custom Search JSON API, requires API key and setup) or potentially via integrated search tools provided by the agent platform.
2.  **Keyword Research Tools (API Access):**
    *   **Purpose:** Obtaining data on search volume, keyword difficulty, related keywords, and SERP analysis.
    *   **Examples:** Google Keyword Planner (requires Google Ads account access), third-party APIs like SEMrush, Ahrefs, Moz (require subscriptions and API keys).
    *   **Integration:** API calls from the agent's code. Access credentials/API keys need secure management (e.g., Secret Manager).
3.  **Internal Knowledge Base/CMS API:**
    *   **Purpose:** Accessing existing content, style guides, approved terminology, and identifying internal linking opportunities.
    *   **Usage:** Querying the CMS/database for existing articles on related topics, retrieving style guide rules.
    *   **Integration:** API calls to the CMS (e.g., WordPress REST API, custom API).

## Communication & Workflow

1.  **Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**
    *   **Purpose:** Receiving task requests and publishing results/drafts.
    *   **Usage:** Subscribing to `agent-requests` topic (filtered for its ID), publishing results to `agent-responses`.
    *   **Integration:** Using Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python (`06_a2a_communication_process.md`).

## Output & Storage

1.  **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) / Firestore / CMS:**
    *   **Purpose:** Storing generated content drafts, research findings, keyword lists, and associated metadata.
    *   **Usage:** Saving markdown files, JSON data, or directly creating draft entries in a CMS.
    *   **Integration:** Using Google Cloud Client Libraries or CMS APIs.

## Supporting Tools

1.  **Google Cloud Logging/Monitoring:**
    *   **Purpose:** Tracking agent activity, performance, and errors.
    *   **Integration:** Standard Python logging libraries configured to send logs to Cloud Logging.
2.  **Google Secret Manager:**
    *   **Purpose:** Securely storing API keys and credentials for external services (Search APIs, Keyword Tools, CMS).
    *   **Integration:** Using Google Cloud Client Libraries to retrieve secrets at runtime.
